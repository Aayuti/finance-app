# MON-E

A new Flutter project.
This is a Mobile App for money management, it is developed in Flutter using Firebase for backend.
The core feature of our Finance-App is the Transaction Tracker, simplifying the process 
of recording expenses and categorizing them for easy tracking. This feature 
allows users to enter their expenses and provides a monthly summary detailing 
where they've spent their money, enabling them to keep a close eye on their 
financial habits and make informed decisions.
